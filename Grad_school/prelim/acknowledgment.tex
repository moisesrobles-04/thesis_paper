\noindent First of all, I want to thank my family, friends, and peers who have been part of this journey. My parents, Mois\'es and Michele, my sister, Maritza, and my partner, Patricia, for the love and support they have given me during this process. Thankful to the THS team that helped make this project possible: Angelo, Fabiola, Celimar, Rosaidy, and Marianyelis. 

Lastly, I want to thank my advisor Manuel Rodr√≠guez, for his mentorship and motivation during these last few years in college. You gave me the opportunity when no one else did and taught me more than I could have hoped.
