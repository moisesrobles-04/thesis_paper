\section{Future Work}

\begin{description}

\item{\textbf{Additional Models for Classification:}} It is possible to train alternative LLM  for the classification tasks.

\item{\textbf{Processing Time:}} During our experiment, we noticed that the misinformation pipeline takes too much time to process. The processing time is mostly caused by the search in the vector database. Exploring different vector databases and similarity search algorithms can improve the processing time.

\item{\textbf{Rebuttal Helpfulness:}} The rebuttal the model generates must be as useful as possible for non-technical readers. That rebuttal can include specific information about the disease, such as symptoms, treatment, statistics, and other relevant factors.
