To facilitate automated processing of nearly 3 million full-text articles (in PubMed Central® Open Access and Author Manuscript subsets) and to improve interoperability, we convert these articles to BioC, a community-driven simple data structure in either XML or JavaScript Object Notation format for conveniently sharing text and annotations.The resultant articles can be downloaded via both File Transfer Protocol for bulk access and a Web API for updates or a more focused collection. Since the availability of the Web API in 2017, our BioC collection has been widely used by the research community.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/APIs/BioC-PMC/.}",
